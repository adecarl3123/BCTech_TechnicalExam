# BCTech technical exam (Salsona, Carl ade)

Hey I am Salsona, Carl Ade and I am apply for the position of C# or .Net developer.

Here is the application that I made based on the instruction of the Technical Exam.
Quick summary:
Frontend:  -Used Angular and bootstrap, added notification upon completing a method using toastr.
BackEnd:   -Used Asp.Net Core for the web api and swagger for testing. 
           -Also used Entity Framework Core 
Database:  -MSSQL Server

Main Functions: 
  -Create, Read, Update and Delete

How to run solution?
-make sure that you already installed Viual Studio for the back-end(c#/.net)
  and Visual Studio Code for the front-end (make sure to install Angular and Node.js)
-you can git pull each file form this repository
      - "EmployeeApi" file for the back-end
      -  "EmployeeList" for the front-end
-run the Visual Studio first and make sure that it is running before running the front-end (VSCode) otherwise the methods will not work.
